Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept, returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found
The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared, returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
